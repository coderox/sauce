/**
 * This suite is intended to be a complete (if stubbed) example of how sauce might be used to manage the dependencies
 * of a typical MVC-like application.  Unlike binding_test, whose aim is coverage across all variations of binding and
 * use, the focus here is on clarity and documentation.
 *
 * Suppose we are creating a web application allowing a Mom & Pop pizza parlour to accept orders online.  Customers can
 * place orders and later inspect order status.  This application runs in a three-tier architecture of a web server
 * backed by app processes talking to a single relational database.
 *
 * Even in this simple application there is complexity to manage, which can be addressed by following the MVC pattern.
 * Vanilla MVC articulates a useful separation of concerns and wraps each in an object.  However it is silent about how
 * those objects are ultimately assembled into the final application; this is where dependency injection (and sauce)
 * can help.
 *
 * Since the point of the technique is to keep components decoupled and unaware of each other, a real application would
 * likely spread its components out across many headers and compilation units.  This poses no problem for sauce, but
 * for clarity everything in this example is contained in this suite.  Comments indicate where suggested file breaks
 * might occur.
